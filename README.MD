# Hand Tracker with CVZONE

## Introduction

A computer vision prototype to track left and right hands of human in a video sequences. This hand tracking prototype could be used to build many computer vision applications.


## Features
- Track hands of human.
- Calculate distance in key point.


## Technologies & Frameworks

- Python 3.8
- OpenCV
- CVzone
- MediaPipe

## What is CVZONE?

CVzone is the main Framework that is used in this prototype, it is a computer vision package that makes us easy to run like face detection, hand tracking, pose estimation, etc., and also image processing and other AI functions.

## What is MediaPipe?

MediaPipe is a framework mainly used for building audio, video, or any time series data. With the help of the MediaPipe framework, we can build very impressive pipelines for different media processing functions.

- Multi-hand Tracking
- Face Detection
- Object Detection and Tracking
- Objectron: 3D Object Detection and Tracking
- AutoFlip: Automatic video cropping pipeline etc.


**Note:** This application is using cvzone as a main framework, MediaPipe will be installed while installing cvzone.

## Configuration and Setup

Python is the main programming language of this prototype, OpenCV and CVzone are the major Frameworks.


- Installing OpenCV

  ```python
  pip install opencv-python
  ```

- Installing cvzone

    ```python
    pip install cvzone
    ```

- Or, Installing cvzone using GitHub, (If "pip install cvzone" does not work)

    ```python
    pip install git+https://github.com/cvzone/cvzone.git
    ```
