# Face Detection with CVZONE

## Introduction

A computer vision prototype to detect faces in a video sequences, this application is used to detect human faces.

Face detection is a computer vision technology being used in a variety of applications that needs to detect human faces in digital images.

Face detection and face recognition are different subjects. Face detection is the process of locating human faces in digital images, whereas the face recognition is identifying the face of a human, this is a sample application of face detection.

## Features
- Detect human faces.
- Point the center region of human faces.


## Technologies & Frameworks

- Python 3.8
- OpenCV
- CVzone

## What is CVZONE?

CVzone is the main Framework that is used in this prototype, it is a computer vision package that makes us easy to run like face detection, hand tracking, pose estimation, etc., and also image processing and other AI functions.


## Configuration and Setup

Python is the main programming language of this prototype, OpenCV and CVzone are the major Frameworks.


- Installing OpenCV

  ```python
  pip install opencv-python
  ```

- Installing cvzone

    ```python
    pip install cvzone
    ```

- Or, Installing cvzone using GitHub, (If "pip install cvzone" does not work)

    ```python
    pip install git+https://github.com/cvzone/cvzone.git
    ```
